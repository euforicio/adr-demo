# Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on our ShopFlow e-commerce platform project. Architecture decisions are important for:

* Understanding the reasoning behind current system design
* Onboarding new team members effectively  
* Avoiding repeated discussions on settled matters
* Learning from past decisions and their outcomes
* Maintaining consistency in architectural approach

We have been making architecture decisions throughout the project, but we have not been recording them systematically. This has led to:

* Lost context about why certain decisions were made
* Repeated debates about previously settled architectural choices
* Difficulty for new team members to understand system rationale
* Inconsistent decision-making processes across the team

We considered several alternatives for recording decisions:
* Confluence/Wiki pages - tend to become outdated and disconnected from code
* Code comments - limited space and not suitable for broader architectural context
* Meeting minutes - scattered across multiple documents and hard to find
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - lightweight, version-controlled, close to code

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to record architecture decisions, following the format standardized at [adr.github.io](https://adr.github.io/).

We will:
* Keep ADRs in the repository as Markdown files under `adr/`
* Number ADRs sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
* Use the standard ADR format: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
* Include C4 model diagrams using Mermaid syntax where helpful for visualization
* Update the main README with an ADR index for easy navigation
* Review ADRs during code review process to ensure quality and completeness

## Consequences

Positive:
* Architecture decisions will be documented and easily accessible
* New team members can understand the reasoning behind current architecture
* We avoid repeating discussions on settled architectural matters
* Decision rationale is preserved for future reference
* ADRs are version-controlled alongside the code they describe

Negative:
* Additional overhead to document decisions
* Team must remember to create ADRs for significant architectural choices
* Need to maintain discipline to keep ADRs up to date

Neutral:
* ADRs become part of our development workflow
* We need to establish criteria for what constitutes an "architectural decision"
* Regular review of ADR status may be needed to deprecate outdated decisions

*This ADR establishes the foundation for architectural decision documentation in our project.*
