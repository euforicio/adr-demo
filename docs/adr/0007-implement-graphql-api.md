# Implement GraphQL API

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our current REST API architecture is becoming increasingly complex as we add new features to the ShopFlow platform. We are experiencing several challenges:

**Current API Challenges:**
* Multiple API calls required to fetch related data (e.g., user profile + orders + shipping info)
* Over-fetching of data on mobile clients with limited bandwidth
* Under-fetching requiring additional API calls for missing information
* Version management complexity with multiple API versions
* Different API endpoints having inconsistent data formats
* Frontend teams struggling with API coordination and data fetching

**Business Requirements:**
* Improve mobile app performance by reducing data transfer
* Enable faster frontend development with flexible data fetching
* Reduce server load from unnecessary data transfers
* Provide real-time capabilities for order tracking and notifications
* Support for multiple client types (web, mobile, admin dashboard)

**Proposed Solution:**
We are considering implementing a GraphQL API layer alongside our existing REST APIs to address these challenges while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Decision

We propose to implement a GraphQL API using Apollo Server that will serve as a unified data layer for our frontend applications.

### Proposed Architecture

        Component(gateway, "API Gateway", "Kong", "Request routing and auth")
        Component(graphql, "GraphQL API", "Apollo Server", "Unified data layer")
        Component(rest, "REST APIs", "Express/Spring", "Existing microservice APIs")
    }
    
    Container_Boundary(services, "Microservices") {
        Component(userSvc, "User Service", "Node.js", "User management")
        Component(catalogSvc, "Catalog Service", "Python", "Product catalog")
        Component(orderSvc, "Order Service", "Java", "Order processing")
        Component(paymentSvc, "Payment Service", "Java", "Payment processing")
    }
    
    Component_Ext(redis, "Redis", "Cache", "Query result caching")
    Component_Ext(dataloader, "DataLoader", "Library", "Batch and cache data requests")
    
    Rel(webApp, gateway, "GraphQL queries")
    Rel(mobileApp, gateway, "GraphQL queries")
    Rel(adminApp, gateway, "GraphQL queries")
    
    Rel(gateway, graphql, "Route GraphQL requests")
    Rel(gateway, rest, "Route REST requests")
    
    Rel(graphql, userSvc, "Fetch user data")
    Rel(graphql, catalogSvc, "Fetch product data")
    Rel(graphql, orderSvc, "Fetch order data")
    Rel(graphql, paymentSvc, "Fetch payment data")
    
    Rel(graphql, redis, "Cache queries")
    Rel(graphql, dataloader, "Batch requests")
```

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Foundation (4 weeks)**
* Set up Apollo Server with basic schema
* Implement user and product queries
* Add authentication and authorization
* Set up DataLoader for efficient data fetching

**Phase 2: Core Features (6 weeks)**
* Add order and payment queries and mutations
* Implement real-time subscriptions for order updates
* Add comprehensive error handling
* Set up query complexity analysis and rate limiting

**Phase 3: Optimization (4 weeks)**
* Implement query caching with Redis
* Add monitoring and performance metrics
* Optimize N+1 query problems with DataLoader
* Add query cost analysis

**Phase 4: Migration (8 weeks)**
* Gradually migrate frontend applications to use GraphQL
* Maintain REST API compatibility
* Performance testing and optimization
* Documentation and developer tooling

### Schema Design Principles
* **Strongly typed**: All data types clearly defined
* **Nullable fields**: Graceful handling of missing data
* **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
* **Versioning**: Schema evolution without breaking changes
* **Security**: Field-level authorization and input validation

## Consequences

**Positive:**
* Improved frontend development velocity with flexible data fetching
* Reduced network overhead and improved mobile performance
* Single endpoint for all data requirements
* Strong typing and introspection capabilities
* Real-time capabilities through subscriptions
* Better developer experience with GraphQL tooling
* Reduced over-fetching and under-fetching issues

**Negative:**
* Additional complexity in the backend architecture
* Learning curve for development team unfamiliar with GraphQL
* Query complexity can lead to performance issues if not monitored
* Caching strategies are more complex than REST
* Additional monitoring and debugging tools required
* Potential security risks with complex queries

**Neutral:**
* Need to maintain both GraphQL and REST APIs during transition
* Requires investment in new tooling and monitoring
* Team training and knowledge transfer required
* Migration timeline will impact feature development velocity
* Additional infrastructure costs for GraphQL server and caching

### Implementation Considerations
* **Backward Compatibility**: REST APIs will remain available during transition
* **Performance Monitoring**: Implement query complexity analysis and timeouts
* **Security**: Add query depth limiting and rate limiting per operation
* **Caching Strategy**: Implement both query-level and field-level caching
* **Error Handling**: Consistent error format across all resolvers
* **Documentation**: Comprehensive schema documentation and examples

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Baseline | Measurement Method |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| API call volume reduction | **30%** | 100 calls/session | Analytics tracking |
| Data transfer reduction | **50%** | 2.5MB/session | Network monitoring |
| Developer satisfaction | **4.5/5** | 3.2/5 | Quarterly survey |
| Feature implementation time | **-40%** | 2 weeks average | Sprint tracking |

  cart: Cart
}

type UserProfile {
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  avatar: String
  preferences: UserPreferences!
}

type Order {
  id: ID!
  status: OrderStatus!
  items: [OrderItem!]!
  total: Money!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  shippingAddress: Address!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  product(id: ID!): Product
  orders(filters: OrderFilters): [Order!]!
}

type Mutation {
  addToCart(productId: ID!, quantity: Int!): Cart!
  updateProfile(input: UpdateProfileInput!): User!
  createOrder(input: CreateOrderInput!): Order!
}

type Subscription {
  orderStatusChanged(orderId: ID!): Order!
  cartUpdated(userId: ID!): Cart!
}
```

### Performance Comparison

> **Note**: These numbers are based on preliminary testing with simulated data.

**REST API (Current)**
- Average response time: ~150ms
- Average payload size: ~85KB  
- Cache hit ratio: ~45%

**GraphQL API (Projected)**  
- Average response time: ~95ms *(37% improvement)*
- Average payload size: ~42KB *(51% reduction)*
- Cache hit ratio: ~78% *(73% improvement)*
